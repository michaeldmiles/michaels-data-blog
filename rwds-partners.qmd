## Funders

Real World Data Science was supported by startup funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

The Alan Turing Institute, headquartered in the British Library, London, was created as the UK's national institute for data science in 2015. In 2017, as a result of a government recommendation, artificial intelligence was added to its remit.  

The Institute is named in honour of Alan Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954), whose pioneering work in theoretical and applied mathematics, engineering and computing are considered to be the key disciplines comprising the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.
